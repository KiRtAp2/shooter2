# shooter2

main file: shooter2.py

input.py and button.py are attempts for me to make an input form / button but rethinking the whole thing before completing.
They're not there to be used. Yet.

base_class.py contains class Base, which is used to make pretty much every other class in game. It's not there to be used, just there to
be inherited from. Method is_hit_by_objects(list_of_objects) is depreciated.

I'll be updating this file when I find anything that's not clear.
